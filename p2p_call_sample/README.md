## Roadmap

- Members call statuses

## Quickstart and develop

Quickstart [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started) app.


## Run

Prepare environment for Flutter and clone the project.

### Run on Android:
- Right mouse button click on `main.dart`;
- Chose 'Run 'main.dart''.

The app will automatically run on your Android device.

### Run on iOS:
- Start Xcode;
- Select `Runner.xcworkspace` to run Xcode project;
- Press the' Build' button to start project building.

The app will automatically run on a selected iOS device or simulator.

### Run on macOS
- Run command from the  Terminal `flutter run -d macos`;
### Run on Windows
- Run command from the  Terminal `flutter run -d windows`;
### Run on Web
- Add own `firebaseConfig` to the file `chat_sample/web/index.html`;
- Run command from the  Terminal `flutter run -d chrome`;

## Receiving calls on the mobile platforms

For notifying mobile platforms we use Connectycube Push notifications feature and own [Connectycube Call Kit plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/connectycube_flutter_call_kit) for supporting Call Kit feature.

### Configure Push notifications:
1. Create your own app in the ConnectyCube admin panel (if not created yet);
2. Create a project in the Firebase developer console (if not created yet);
3. Add the Server API key from the Firebase developer console to the ConnectyCube admin panel for the Android platform ([short guide](https://developers.connectycube.com/flutter/push-notifications?id=android));
4. Add Apple certificate for the iOS platform ([short guide, how to generate and set it to the admin panel](https://developers.connectycube.com/ios/push-notifications?id=create-apns-certificate)). But instead of an APNS certificate, you should choose a VoIP certificate;
5. Add `google-services.json` file from the Firebase developer console to the Android app by path `p2p_call_sample/android/app/`
6. Configure file `p2p_call_sample/lib/src/utils/configs.dart` with your endpoints from the 1st. point of this guide;
7. Create users in the ConnectyCube admin panel and add them to the configure file `p2p_call_sample/lib/src/utils/configs.dart`
8. Build and run the app as usual;
