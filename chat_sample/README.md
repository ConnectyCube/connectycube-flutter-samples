## Quickstart and develop

Quickstart [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started) app.


## Run

Prepare environment for Flutter and clone the project.

### Run on Android:
- Right mouse button click on `main.dart`;
- Chose 'Run 'main.dart''.

The app will automatically run on your Android device.

### Run on iOS:
- Start Xcode;
- Select `Runner.xcworkspace` to run Xcode project;
- Press the' Build' button to start project building.

The app will automatically run on a selected iOS device or simulator.

### Run on macOS
- Run command from the Terminal `flutter run -d macos`;
### Run on Windows
- Run command from the Terminal `flutter run -d windows`;
### Run on Web
- Run command from the Terminal `flutter run -d chrome`;

or follow the [link](https://connectycube.github.io/connectycube-flutter-samples/chat_sample/build/web) to take a look at the deployed version
### Run on Linux
- Run command from the Terminal `flutter run -d linux`;

### Configure Push notifications:
1. Create your own app in the ConnectyCube admin panel (if not created yet);
2. Create a project in the Firebase developer console (if not created yet);
3. Add the Server API key from the Firebase developer console to the ConnectyCube admin panel for the Android platform ([short guide](https://developers.connectycube.com/flutter/push-notifications?id=android));
4. Add Apple certificate for the iOS platform ([short guide, how to generate and set it to the admin panel](https://developers.connectycube.com/ios/push-notifications?id=create-apns-certificate));
5. Generate config file `firebase_options.dart` via [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/)(the simple util provided for avoiding manual configuration for each platforms) and put it by place `lib/firebase_options.dart`;
6. Build and run the app as usual;

> **Note:** For working with push notifications on the macOS platform you should generate a separate certificate similar to p.4 but with other app bundle id.

> **Note:** For displaying notifications on the Web platform from the background you should feel the file `web/firebase-messaging-sw.js` with data from your Firebase developer console.
